# noise_denoise
introduction to noise types and denoising methods
In this project, we first apply Salt and Pepper, Speckle, Poisson, and Gaussian noises to the test dataset, which includes color images in three fields: medical, normal, and aerial. Then, we try to obtain the best filter based on the PSNR and SSIMS criteria by applying smoothing filters (median, blur, Bilateral), sharpening filters (Laplacian, Sobel, Robert, High-pass, Unsharp Masking), wavelet (Haar, Coiflet, Gaussian, Shannon), and shearlet.
